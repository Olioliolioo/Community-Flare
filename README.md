- Slash commands for various stuff, like /comf to check some counts inside a Battleground.
- Warning before accidentically casting a Hearthstone or Teleporting out of a Battleground.
- Restrict users from using the PING system without being Raid Leader or Assistant.
- Base code for different Locales, so far, only enUS added for support. (If you want to translate to others, please contact Mesostealthy in Alterac Valley Maniacs, or comment down below.)
